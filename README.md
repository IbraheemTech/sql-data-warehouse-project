# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

# 🧠 Data Warehousing & Analytics Pipeline Project 🚀

Welcome to my end-to-end **Data Warehousing & Analytics Portfolio Project**, where raw, messy data transforms into insightful and actionable business intelligence. This project demonstrates how to build a clean, scalable, and analytics-ready data pipeline using **ETL processes**, **data warehousing techniques**, and **business logic modeling**.
