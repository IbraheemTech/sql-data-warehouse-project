# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

# 🧠 Data Warehousing & Analytics Pipeline Project 🚀

Welcome to my end-to-end **Data Warehousing & Analytics Portfolio Project**, where raw, messy data transforms into insightful and actionable business intelligence. This project demonstrates how to build a clean, scalable, and analytics-ready data pipeline using **ETL processes**, **data warehousing techniques**, and **business logic modeling**.

## 🔍 Project Objective

> "**Raw data is a treasure chest. You just need the right tools to unlock it.**"

The goal of this project is to:
- Ingest **raw and unstructured data**
- Perform **cleaning and transformation** using ETL best practices
- Store the data in a **standardized and optimized data warehouse**
- Derive insights using **analytical queries** and **business logic rules**
